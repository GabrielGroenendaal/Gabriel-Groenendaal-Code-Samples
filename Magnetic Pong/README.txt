# MAGNETIC PONG

Magnetic Pong is a twist on the classic Player vs. Player Pong gameplay where everything from the walls, the ball, and the paddles are magnetically charged. Players can swap between positive and negative charges on their paddle, and must learn to use both to overcome their foes. 

# Controls
Two-player game where each player controls one magnetic "paddle" that alternates between postive and negative polarity using "A" for the left paddle, "right arrow" for the right paddle. Score points by guiding the ball into the backwalls.
